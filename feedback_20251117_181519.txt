suggestions for improvement:
- In the `PetDog.play` method, the logic to add the name might be slightly flawed as it stands. it appends a list to the all_dog_names instead of appending the names in the list directly.
- Consider adding docstrings to your classes and methods to improve readability and maintainability.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding type hints to improve readability and maintainability.
- The `fight` method could be refactored slightly to avoid redundant calculations, although the performance impact is minimal.

suggestions for improvement:
- The play method can be improved, the all_dog_names list and the check for empty strings are not needed. Also, the f string is not working: print(f'{', '.join(dog_names)} play together!')
- Make sure that the Dog class is imported from the correct file and that the import statement is correct.
- Remove the parameter list in the init function. super().__init__(name, age, weight) already passes the attributes to the parent class
