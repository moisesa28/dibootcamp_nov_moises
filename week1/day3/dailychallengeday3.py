#Daily Challenge: Dictionaries
#Challenge 1: Letter Index Dictionary
# Goal: Create a dictionary that stores the indices (number of the position)
#  of each letter in a word provided by the user(input()).
# Instructions:

# 1. User Input:
# Ask the user to enter a word.
# Store the input word in a variable.
word = input('Please enter a word: ')

# 2. Creating the Dictionary:

# Iterate through each character of the input word using a loop.
# And check if the character is already a key in the dictionary.
# If it is, append the current index to the list associated with that key.
# If it is not, create a new key-value pair in the dictionary.
# Ensure that the characters (keys) are strings.
# Ensure that the indices (values) are stored in lists.
