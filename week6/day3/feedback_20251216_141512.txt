suggestions for improvement:
- For better readability, consider adding comments to complex queries explaining the purpose of each join and filter.
- In task 3 of exercise 1, the join condition `ON film.film_id = language.language_id` is incorrect. It should be `ON film.language_id = language.language_id`. While the rest of the query seems correct, double-checking these conditions is always good practice.
Correctness: 100%
