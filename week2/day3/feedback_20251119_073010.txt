suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 1, the `__add__` method should raise a TypeError when currencies are different, as the instructions specify, instead of returning the current object. The `__iadd__` method can also be changed to raise a TypeError instead of a ValueError.
- In Exercise 1, it is better to avoid using return self on the `__add__` and define the TypeError exception as in the instructions.
- In Exercise 1, the `__repr__` method should return a string that can be used to recreate the object. Currently, it creates a string that, if executed, would result in a NameError because `Currency` is not defined within the string. Consider returning a simple string representation instead, like 'Currency object'.
- In Exercise 1, the output is not what's expected as shown in the instructions. Please fix it so it matches the instructions.
